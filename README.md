# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
This repo is to store files and assignments for MSU's Data Analysis Bootcamp (Spring 2022).
The first assignment was to manipulate and synthesis data gathered from Kickstarter with an eye towards kickstarter theater projects in the United States and Great Britain.
---

The purpose of this assignment was to take data available through Kickstarter's API and use it to give recommendations to an aspiring playwrite who is interested in using the platform to fund a future projects.

The purpose of the analysis was to identify facors in the success and failure of previous campaigns in the United States realted to theatrical arts. The first thing I looked at was the success and failure rate of all the campaigns hosted by Kickstarter when broken down by Catagory. The graph below shows that theatre projects are one of the popular types of fundraising campaigns. It also shows that the rate of success of theater campaigns is very good compaired to other catagories with only music and film projects having similar success rates.

The analysis aslo shows a corrilation between the launch date of a campaign and it's chances of being successful within the United States. The following chart shows that campaigns launched during the summer have a much better chance of sucess than those launched in the colder months

There a number of takeaways after looking at the data. First of all successful campaigns in the Unted States had a mean goal of $5,049 while unsuccessful campaigns were asking for much more. The Mean goal of the unsuccessful campaigns, $10,554 is more than double that of those that succeed. This bodes well for our playwrite because her ask, $2000, is withing the inter quartile range and below both the mean and median of similar campaigns that were a success. These figures come from the sheet called "Descriptive Statistics" in the included Excel file.

The playwrite is also interested in the market for musical theater in Great Britian. I compaired the stated goals and the pledged amount for all campaigns in the subcatagory Musicals in Great Britian. The finding are summerized in the chart below.

After looking at the data my recomendation to Louise, the playwrite would be keep her budget and goal number where it is. The campaign's goal falls into a range that other similar projects are able to find success in. I would also recomend launching her fundraising campaign in June as that month has the best success rate for similar projects.

# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
This repo is to store files and assignments for MSU's Data Analysis Bootcamp (Spring 2022).
The first assignment was to manipulate and synthesis data gathered from Kickstarter with an eye towards kickstarter theater projects in the United States and Great Britain. 

The purpose of this assignment was to take data available through Kickstarter's API and use it to give recommendations to an aspiring playwrite who is interested in using the platform to fund a future projects.

The purpose of the analysis was to identify facors in the success and failure of previous campaigns realted to theatrical arts. The first thing I looked at was the success and failure rated of all the campaigns hosted by Kickstarter when broken down by Catagory. The graph below shows that theatre projects are one of the popular types of fundraising campaigns. It also shows that the rate of success of theater campaigns is very good compaired to other catagories with only music and film projects having similar success rates.
